    script: `Find a comfortable position, either sitting on a chair with your feet flat on the floor, or on a cushion on the floor. Allow your back to be straight but not stiff. Gently close your eyes.

Bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils, filling your lungs, and then leaving your body. Don't try to change your breathing in any way. Simply observe it.

As you breathe, you may notice your mind wandering. This is completely normal. When you realize your mind has wandered, gently and without judgment, guide your attention back to your breath.

Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest or abdomen with each inhale and exhale. Rest in this awareness of your breath for a few moments.

Notice the coolness of the air as you breathe in, and the warmth as you breathe out.

Continue this for a few more minutes, allowing your breath to be your anchor to the present moment.

When you're ready, slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes. And when you feel ready, gently open your eyes.`,

    title: 'Body Scan Meditation',
    script: `Begin by finding a comfortable position, lying on your back if possible, with your arms by your sides and your legs uncrossed. Close your eyes gently.

Bring your awareness to your breath for a few moments, noticing the sensation of breathing in and out.

Now, bring your attention to the toes of your left foot. Notice any sensations you feel there - perhaps warmth, coolness, tingling, or contact with your sock or the air. If you don't feel anything, that's okay too. Just be aware of your toes.

Slowly, expand your awareness to include the entire left foot. The sole, the heel, the top of the foot. Hold your foot in your mind's eye.

Now, move your attention up to your left lower leg, your calf and shin. Then to your knee, and your thigh. Be aware of any and all sensations.

Bring your full attention to your entire left leg, from your toes to your hip.

Now, shift your focus to the toes of your right foot. Repeat the process, slowly scanning your awareness up through your right foot, lower leg, knee, and thigh, until you are aware of your entire right leg.

Continue this process, moving your awareness through your pelvis, your abdomen, your lower back, and your chest. Notice the gentle movement of your breath in these areas.

Scan your awareness through your hands, up your arms, and into your shoulders.

Move your focus to your neck, your face - your jaw, your mouth, your nose, your eyes, your forehead. Release any tension you might be holding.

Finally, bring your awareness to the very top of your head. Feel a sense of wholeness, being aware of your entire body, breathing, here and now.

Rest in this full-body awareness for as long as you'd like.

When you're ready, slowly bring your attention back to the space around you. Gently move your fingers and toes, and open your eyes.`,

    title: 'Loving-Kindness Meditation',
    script: `Sit in a comfortable and relaxed position. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to settle your body and mind.

Bring to mind a feeling of warmth and kindness. You can start by offering this kindness to yourself. Silently repeat the following phrases, directed towards yourself:

May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be safe.
May I live with ease.

Feel the intention behind these words. If you find it difficult, that's okay. Just continue to repeat the phrases gently.

Now, bring to mind a loved one, a good friend or family member. Picture them in your mind's eye. Direct your feelings of loving-kindness towards them, repeating the phrases:

May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with ease.

Next, think of a neutral person, someone you don't have strong feelings about. It could be a neighbor or a cashier at a store. Offer the same phrases of loving-kindness to them.

Now, bring to mind someone with whom you have difficulty. This can be challenging, so if it's too much, you can return to the neutral person. If you feel able, offer them the same wishes:

May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with ease.

Finally, expand your awareness to include all living beings everywhere, without exception. Extend your loving-kindness to everyone:

May all beings be happy.
May all beings be healthy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings live with ease.

Sit with this feeling of universal, unconditional love for a few moments. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes.`,
